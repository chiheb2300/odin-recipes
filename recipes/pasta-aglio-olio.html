    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To prepare the garlic, oil and chili pepper spaghetti, start by cooking the pasta in boiling salted water. Cook the spaghetti al dente.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the meantime prepare the seasoning: peel the garlic cloves, divide them in half and remove the core (the green central part of each clove).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the pan over very low heat and add the sliced garlic and chili peppers. Continue to fry over very low heat; the chili and garlic should not burn, and should only fry for a couple of minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            For even browning without the risk of burning, you can tilt the pan to gather the oil, garlic and chili peppers in one area and allow them to brown evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the pasta is cooked al dente, you can transfer it directly into the pan             and add a ladle of cooking water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir for a few moments to combine the flavors and saut√©, then you can plate your garlic, oil and chili pepper spaghetti and serve very hot!
        </li>
